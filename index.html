            <h2>Google <span>June 2012-August 2018</span></h2>
            Worked as a Site Reliability Engineer for Google's storage 
systems for two years, then as a Software Engineer on a Search Analysis 
team, then on a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.area120.grasshopper">coding education app</a>
 as a "co-founder of an internal start-up". Designed the general 
teaching structure for the app - a series of puzzles, with each one 
introducing a new concept, and just-in-time feedback within the puzzles -
 designed most of the initial curriculum, and outlined the structure for
 the subsequent courses. Presented some of this work at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=8116722">Blocks &amp; Beyond Conference</a>.
            <br>Throughout my Google career, I've taken part in many education-related side projects, including:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pencil Code</strong>(<a href="http://pencilcode.net/">pencilcode.net</a>)
 - an open-source web-based educational IDE which incorporates turtle 
graphics and block code to teach real-world languages and technologies 
(JS, CoffeeScript, HTML, CSS). Led the design of a modular 10-week 
curriculum and developed various additional educational content(puzzles,
 games, code samples, video tutorials).</li>
              <li><strong>Computer Science Summer Institute</strong> - 
taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to a group of 30 rising college 
freshmen from underrepresented minorities. Modified the existing 
curriculum to integrate JS with HTML immediately, instead of teaching 
the CS theory first and merging the two later.</li>
              <li><strong>Google In Residence</strong> - Went on two separate one-semester (full-time) rotation, teaching CS courses to students at HBCUs. 
                <ul>
                  <li>taught an Intro to CS course and an advanced seminar at Hampton University in Fall 2014</li>
                  <li>taught Web Development at Dillard University in 
Spring 2017, and designed a hands-on curriculum with a companion web 
app, which the students first used as a learning tool and then 
contributed code to.</li>
                  <li>Developed a mini-curriculum for an interview training workshop series.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Oppia</strong>(<a href="https://www.oppia.org/">oppia.org</a>)
 - an open-source platform for creating interactive educational content.
 Participated in early design and implementation. Made sample content of
 varying length and complexity, created design guidelines for other 
content creators, drafted design documents for community-building social
 features.</li>
              <li><strong>Citizen Schools</strong> - taught 4 semesters 
of programming classes, starting with the Bootstrap curriculum and then 
designing new Scratch- and Pencil Code-based curricula. Our students' 
final presentations were consistently popular with audiences of 
engineers, and students were extremely excited about programming.</li>
              <li>Various other formal and informal mentorship programs,
 including mock interviews, curriculum design, and one-off panels and 
workshops.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>RIT<span>Research and Teaching assistant - 2010-2012</span></h2>
            Found ways to emulate really old games for the Preserving 
Virtual Worlds 2 project - a collaboration between several universities 
and the Library of Congress to preserve classical game experiences.<br>
            Helped conduct playtests of educational games, and later 
encode recordings of these playtests for research on the effect of the 
game on student understanding of physics.<br>
            Taught and tutored students in topics ranging from introductory programming to game physics and game AI.<br>
            Taught several one-off children's CS classes using various tools, including Scratch, PicoCrickets, and CS Unplugged.<br>

          <h2>iD Tech Camps<span>Instructor - summers 2010-2011</span></h2>
          Taught C++ and Java to campers ages 10-17. Conducted 8-10 
week-long programming courses per summer. Iterated heavily on the 
introductory programming curriculum, and formed a good basis of 
understanding of how different people learn to program. Got consistent 
strong positive feedback about my teaching style from both students and 
fellow instructors.<br>

          Worked as a contractor for the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 
Laboratory(GFDL). Processed data from climate models, assisted with 
custom post-processing and analyses, developed and supported a web-based
 data portal.
